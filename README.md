# 1. Introduction

I am an Electrical Engineering student specializing in **analog and digital VLSI IC design**, 
with hands-on experience using **open-source EDA tools** and the **SkyWater 130nm technology**. 
I am a member of the **DIICES research group (Design Innovation on IC and Embedded Systems)**.

This repository showcases a curated portfolio of **end-to-end VLSI IC design projects**, 
covering schematic and RTL design, physical implementation, and verification workflows.
